# Employee Management System

## Overview

This project is a simple Django application that stores employee data. It provides endpoints to:

1. Get a list of employees
2. Get details of a single employee
3. Create a new employee

The application uses a `.env` file for configuration, including the database URL.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL or another supported database
- `pip` for installing Python packages
