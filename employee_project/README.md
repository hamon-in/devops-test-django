# Employee Management System

## Overview

This project is a simple Django application that stores employee data. It provides endpoints to:

1. Get a list of employees
2. Get details of a single employee
3. Create a new employee

The application uses a `.env` file for configuration, including the database URL.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL or another supported database
- `pip` for installing Python packages

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-management-system.git
cd employee-management-system
```
### Create a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Configure the Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project with the following content:
```makefile
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME
```
Replace the placeholders in DATABASE_URL with your actual database credentials.

### Apply Migrations
Run the following commands to set up the database schema:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
## Running the Project
To start the development server, use:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
You can access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

This will execute all the test cases defined in the employee app.
